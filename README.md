Python modules for typical travel demand modeling calculations
<p class=MsoNormal>Contributors: Chetan Joshi, Portland OR</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Requires: Python with standard modules and numpy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tested With: Data from DVRPC and Waterloo demand models</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Description: These are some python scripts that can be used
as modules for performing typicaly calculations in a travel demand model. The
expected usage is to put the py file in the site packages or other directory
and then to use the import command in python to load the functions in the
modules. The documentation for usage of each of the functions is shown in the
python scripts and it should also show up in the help as you type the function.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Have fun!</p>
